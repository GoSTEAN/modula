            <br>Purpose: JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to add interactivity to web pages. It is also used in a variety of other applications, such as mobile apps and game development.
            <br>Where used: JavaScript is used in the browser. It can be used to create interactive elements, such as buttons, menus, and forms. It can also be used to make web pages more dynamic, such as by updating the content of a page based on user input.
